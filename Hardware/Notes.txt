So we will connect RCC_MCO_1 to the input clock of the camera. The camera has no explicits
max clock rate, however I believe that when it sends data back, the rate is based on what
we provide. The STM32F207 only supports up to 54Mhz. However because we use the master clock
output, we can configure and play with the exact rate so that it works best by
programming the MCU.
